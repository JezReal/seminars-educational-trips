## C Language

### I. Details of the event/activity
The webinar was organized by our team, CS-HEJJHOG and our speaker was Mr. Arthur Tristan Ramos, an alumnus from Gordon College. The topic was all about the C programming language and is aimed for first years because he webinar's main purpose is to serve as their reviewer to prepare them for their final examinations.

### II. Reflections on the seminar/activity gives rise to
Since this is my first-time taking part in organizing an event, I realized how difficult it is. There are so many moving parts, and I am thankful because some of my groupmates already have an experience in organizing webinars which made the procss a lot easier and overall, less stressful.

### III. Reflections on possibilities on implementing some of the webinar input on a practical level (practical application of learnings)
The main thing that I learned from this webinar and that I want to implement in our future webinars, is the importance of preparation and communication not just with the speaker but with the team as well. Preparing different aspects of the event such as the poster, the program of the event among others takes time so we must make sure that these are all ready before the event and also being able to communicate with the speaker as well should they have any concerns about the event.

### IV. Positive Feedback (on the event organization)
Even though it was my first-time being part of the organizer of an event, I think that the team did a really good job. Whenever the speaker takes a break, we attempt to not have dead air by having short breaks.

### V. Suggestions for improvements to be made/consider for future activities
While I think that the webinar achieved its goal, I think that there are things that we, as a team could have done better, mainly, to have more preparation time for the event. I think that if we prepared for the event earlier, we could have organized the event better.
