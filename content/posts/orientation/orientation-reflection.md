### I. Details of the event/activity
The student orientation was conducted at the function hall of Gordon College last August 18, 2022 and was conducted by the College of Computer Studies. Although we attended the event face-to-face, it was also streamed live through Zoom and Facebook so that those students that cannot attend will also be able to join the event albeit online. 

The event's main objective was to orient the CCS students regarding the policies and guidelines that must be followed by the student specifically in the College of Computer Studies. Other topics relating to the college was also discussed such as the various organizations that were formed, activities that were conducted by the college, among others. 

The event also recognizes the outstanding students of BSCS on their academic performance AY 2021-2022. 

### II. Reflections on the seminar/activity gives rise to
First of all, the event was a great change of pace since the 2 years of online classes. It was great having to see my classmates and instructors not just through Google meet or Zoom, but face to face.

I was also reminded of the things that we should take note of one of which being the meaning of various grades that are given to you by your instructor. A grade of INC means that your requirements for the course are incomplete and you should comply and pass the tasks that you need to complete until the next semester so your grade can be changed. NFE means *No final exam*, which from the meaning of the acronym itself, says that you still haven't taken your final examination for the course. Upon receiving this grade, you only have 10 days to take your final exam. FDA means *Failure due to absences*. It means that you failed the course because you exceeded the allowed amount of absences. If you meet only once a week, you are allowed three absences while if you meet two times a week, you are only allowed six absences. Once you exceed this number, your instructor can automatically give you an FDA for the course.

Other things that were discussed in the event were the various community extension projects that were conducted by the College, headed by Mr. Reynaldo Bautista Jr. as well as various projects that are planned by *SPECS*, the organization representing Computer Science.

### III. Reflections on possibilities on implementing some of the webinar input on a practical level (practical application of learnings)
We can look at how the organizers managed the event and use it as a blueprint in conducting our own seminars/webinars. Since we are also required to conduct various seminars and webinars for the students, we can learn from how the organizers coordinated every part of the event and hopefully be able to conduct events that are not only successful at achieving its objectives, but also make them fun and engaging for those that will join.

### IV. Positive Feedback (on the event organization)
Although the event took a few hours because of the various agenda that needs to be discussed, intermission numbers were conducted as well as ice breakers to make sure that not every participant just falls asleep throughout the event. Furthermore, giveaways were also conducted to incentivize students joining the event both online and face-to-face.

### V. Suggestions for improvements to be made/consider for future activities
For my suggestions for improvement, there is only one thing that I would like to suggest which is the attendance monitoring of the participants. In order to record the attendance of the student, they must scan a QR code which takes them to a Google form. This poses a problem for those that attended the event face-to-face that does not have an internet connection since there is also a time limit that the form is open. In my opinion, in future seminars/webinars, it is important for the organizers to also consider how the attendance of the participants that joins their event face-to-face will be recorded.
