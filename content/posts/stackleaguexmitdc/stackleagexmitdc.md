## Modern IT Delivery on Cloud

### I. Details of the event/activity
StackLeague x MITDC was an online webinar that was conducted by StackLeague in collaboration with Manulife IT Delivery Center (MITDC) last October 5, 2022. It was a session that focuses on cloud native applications as well as leveraging serverless solutions. 

The event started with a brief introduction of MITDC and their culture, what they do as a company, as well as sharing the technology stack that they are using. It then proceeded with the various tech talks and having icebreaker games in between.

### II. Reflections on the seminar/activity gives rise to
One of the main things that I learned from the session was how software is currently moving in the cloud and how cloud providers are making it easier than ever to do so. In MSBUILD 2022, they discussed how Azure supports almost all use cases for the cloud ranging from simple applications to Artificial Intelligence. I thought that maybe it was just an "advertisement" of sorts for the Azure services since Microsoft was the host of the event. But in this session, MITDC has said that they have been using Azure for deploying their cloud applications which was surprising for me because I was under the impression that companies do manage their own servers and have people that are dedicated in running them. However, it was discussed in the session that using cloud providers is much more cost and time efficient since you don't need dedicated people to manage your servers, and you can also save time because you only need to worry about deploying your application to the cloud. 

These cloud services do not just stop at managing your servers because they also have what we call "serverless solutions". It might be confusing at first because how would you run an application if you don't have a server? It actually means that you no longer need to worry about configuring your server and implementing common tasks such as file upload. By just installing a few packages, you can easily implement a feature in your application and save a lot of time. 

### III. Reflections on possibilities on implementing some of the webinar input on a practical level (practical application of learnings)
The main thing that I want to be able to use on a practical level is the use of major cloud platforms especially running cloud native applications. Although I have used cloud platforms before to deploy backend services however, they are not cloud native applications as they are basically just monolithic applications. Another thing that I want to explore are serverless functions as I am interested in the speed and ease that they offer when developing new features.

### IV. Positive Feedback (on the event organization)
Even though the event was held online, the organizers were still able to make it interesting and engaging for the audience as not only are the hosts great and funny, but they also had games which kept the audience involved and interested all throughout the session. 

### V. Suggestions for improvements to be made/consider for future activities
The only suggestion that I will say is to maybe prepare a bit more for the presentations since there were times the speakers encountered technical difficulties such as their mic not being heard properly, or the video is not showing properly. However, it did not really take away the learnings and fun from the session.
