### I. Details of the event/activity
This webinar was also organized by our team with yours truly as the resource speaker. Its aim is to give a brief introduction of the Kotlin programming language.

### II. Reflections on the seminar/activity gives rise to
In this webinar, I was the speaker so I focused mainly on making my material that I will be using for the webinar and compared to being an organizer, I think that being a speaker is a lot easier. I only have to worry about the instructional material that I will be using and not much about the flow of the event, how are we going to market the event, etc.

### III. Reflections on possibilities on implementing some of the webinar input on a practical level (practical application of learnings)
I think that this time the team had a much better event in general. We tried to stick to the schedule as much as possible and I think that it paid off given that we had two consecutive webinars to conduct during that day. 

### IV. Positive Feedback (on the event organization)
The main positive feedback that I have is that the team were able to follow and stick to our schedule. In our previous webinar, we exceeded the time which in one side is great because it was still able to impart knowledge to our audience but on the other side, we still exceeded our expected time which is less than ideal.

### V. Suggestions for improvements to be made/consider for future activities
The main suggestion that I have is to improve our future webinars is maybe to have some sort of interaction with the audience to encourage them to engage with the discussion
