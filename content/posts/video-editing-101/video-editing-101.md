### I. Details of the event/activity
The webinar was organized by my fellow BSCS4 students, and the session focuses mainly on the basics of video editing using Adobe Premiere Pro.

### II. Reflections on the seminar/activity gives rise to
The session helped me in having a basic idea of editing videos. The speaker explained the concepts in a way that is easily understandable by people who does not have much experience with editing videos. Furthermore, a great takeaway from the session was the general process of editing videos which is to be able to tell a story from all the different aspects that are in the video (clips, audio, etc.).

### III. Reflections on possibilities on implementing some of the webinar input on a practical level (practical application of learnings)
The thing that I want to implement on a practical level for this webinar is mainly, being able to tell a story from the video that you created. No matter how many fancy effects you put in the video, if the story that you are trying to tell is incoherent, it will not be a good video.

### IV. Positive Feedback (on the event organization)
The speaker explained the topic really well and the questions from the audience were properly addressed.

### V. Suggestions for improvements to be made/consider for future activities
When the speaker was editing the audio clip for the video, technical difficulties were encountered which made the audio sound weird. It would be nice if issues like that would be prevented next time.
