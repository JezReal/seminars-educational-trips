### I. Details of the event/activity
This is the final webinar that was organized by our team, and it focuses on designing websites or webpages using PenPot with our speaker being Mr. Mark Thaddeus Manuel. 

### II. Reflections on the seminar/activity gives rise to
Since this is our last webinar, I think that we were able to organize it well especially considering we held the last two webinars consecutively. We were able to start and end the event on time while still being able to impart knowledge to the audience.

### III. Reflections on possibilities on implementing some of the webinar input on a practical level (practical application of learnings)
I think that this webinar session was a great indicator of how much the team can do. Being able to organize just one webinar is already hard and stressful enough but doing it for two consecutive webinars without messing up really bad was in my opinion, a great feat. While it is not ideal to conduct multiple webinars on the same day, it was still great that the team was able to do it.

### IV. Positive Feedback (on the event organization)
Just like in the last webinar, since they were held consecutive of each other, I think that the team's time management was amazing. It is very common to exceed from the planned time of the event and being able to follow our schedule was I think the main positive takeaway from this event.

### V. Suggestions for improvements to be made/consider for future activities
I think that conducting multiple webinars on a single day can be a bit exhausting both for the audience and the organizers. I would suggest that for future webinars we should try and conduct only one webinar a day, but we were running out of time which is understandable in this case.
