## Cyber Defense Society

### I. Details of the event/activity
The event was organized by Trend Micro PH and it focuses on cybersecurity. To be specific, in this event, the talks focused on email phishing scams as well as how to prevent them. Some speakers also shared their experiences working with Trend Micro and there was also a Capture the Flag (CTF) event in at the end of the event which was really fun.

### II. Reflections on the seminar/activity gives rise to
My main learning from the event was about email phishing scams. There was a speaker that talked about email phishing in-depth which was very informative and then at the end, to reinforce our learning, a Capture the Flag (CTF) event was held in the form of a game wherein we have to go through multiple rooms, find what is needed to unlock the door and then get to the next stage until you reach the final door. That game was really fun since it allowed you to immediately apply what you learned from the talks about email phishing scams and investigating whether an email is actually legitimate or not.

### III. Reflections on possibilities on implementing some of the webinar input on a practical level (practical application of learnings)
The thing that I can implement from the event was how to spot phishing emails. As we all are aware, phishing scams are getting more and more believable these days and thus, more dangerous. Knowing how to trace the source of an email and seeing if it is legitimate or not is a great help in avoiding possible scams. 

### IV. Positive Feedback (on the event organization)
The event was really enjoyable even though there were multiple talks, the speakers found a way to keep their topics interesting.

### V. Suggestions for improvements to be made/consider for future activities
I think that the organizers could have allotted more time for the CTF event because towards the middle you can see that they are trying to rush and finish the game to follow their schedule. While it is nice to follow the schedule, I think that in this case it slightly made the experience just a little bit undesirable.
