## Containerization and Orchestration

### I. Details of the event/activity
The webinar was another event that was held in collaboration with StackLeague and Manulife IT Delivery Center (MITDC) and it mainly focuses on giving an overview of microservices.

As with their previous sessions, they started by introducing the company, MITDC, their company culture and the tech stack that they use. They also had games and gave prizes to the winners which I won as well. 

### II. Reflections on the seminar/activity gives rise to
The session solidified my understanding of microservices and container orchestration. As I am interested in backend development, microservices has always piqued my intellect and although I tried to find resources to learn about them, this session is only one of the very few resources that really helped me understand the concept. 

Microservices are essentially used if you have a large application, and you only need to scale certain parts of it. The given example was a shopping backend wherein it has different parts (search products, manager cart, checkout, manage products, etc.). There are cases wherein you only need to scale the checkout service and using microservices you can easily do that by just increasing the number of "instances" of that specific service. Another advantage that was discussed was that different teams can handle different parts of the backend which enables them to just focus on certain features/aspects of the backend.

The session also touched on concepts of Docker and Kubernetes such as pods, nodes, api gateways, services. etc. 

### III. Reflections on possibilities on implementing some of the webinar input on a practical level (practical application of learnings)
The part of the session that I really want to implement on a practical level is the use of Kubernetes for backend services. In our thesis, we are already using Docker and Docker Compose that basically spins up our backend and the database that we are using. Although there is not much point implementing microservices in our thesis, I would like to be able to implement it in a simple project.

### IV. Positive Feedback (on the event organization)
The event was well organized, and you can clearly see that the speakers are really well prepared for their talks. The game was also really nice as it gives you a way to check the knowledge that you gained from the session and at the same time win prizes if you were in the top 5.

### V. Suggestions for improvements to be made/consider for future activities
The only thing that I want to improve in the event is that there are times when the microphone of the speakers was inaudible and makes it hard to understand what the speakers are saying.
