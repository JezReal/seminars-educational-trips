This year, the keynote highlights 10 main things namely: Developer flow, Cloud ubiquity, App ubiquity, Cloud-native, Unified data, Models as platforms, Hybrid AI, Low-code/no-code, Collaborative apps and Metaverse. Furthermore, they also highlighted how some companies or individuals have used these concepts to be able to solve their problems and one that I found that is particularly interesting is the use of metaverse by Kawasaki Heavy Industries to troubleshoot their robots. By using the metaverse, they can consult various experts no matter where they are to help troubleshoot which makes the process much faster.\nThe event also had various tech sessions discussing topics such as responsible artifical intelligence, cloud native among others to give an overview as well as some Azure offerings that can be used to solve these types of problems.\nFinally, the event also had games that helps engage the audience (even online) to keep them entertained throughout the event.\nII. Reflections on the seminar/activity gives rise to One of the main things that I realized on the event was how easy it is now for someone to develop their application idea be it a mobile app, a web application or even an app that uses artificial intelligence. There was a service that you could use wherein you can just draw a wireframe of your dream application, be it a mobile app or a web app, and it can automatically create the ui for you. You only need to tweak very few things and you are good to go on the UI design. One thing that I also found really interesting was another service that will be offered by Azure wherein you can implement an Artificial Intelligence by only interacting with an api. I thought it was really interesting because it significantly lowers the barrier in the artificial intelligence field and it also makes it so that you don’t really need to go and learn lots of theory and mathematics to solve a problem with artificial intelligence. While it is true that understanding how the ai works is important, we also cannot just ignore the amount of time that will be saved because of a much simpler api.\nAnother thing that I learned and personally am really interested in was the talk about cloud native. Microservices are basically the craze right now when it comes to developing your backend. A most basic definition would be that microservice is an architectural style of building applications wherein they are a collection of services that are loosely coupled and are independently deployable. This also allows the developers to develop the application in whatever language or framework they think is fit for the service to be able to solve the problem. I found that idea very appealling mainly because of the fact that you are not really “locked in” to a specific framework or language especially if it can no longer do the job properly. However, the problem becomes “how do you make these different services talk to each other?”. This is where containers and container orchestration comes in. You basically create an “image” of each service and then the orchestration framework will do the work of making these various services look like one whole.\nWhile the idea looks very tempting, the learning curve is very steep as you, the developer, should have knowledge about infrastructure as well as networking. Luckily, in the tech session, it was mentioned that Azure will have an offering that attempts to make that process a lot easier, eliminating lots of the headaches of setting your containers up and therefore, gives you more time to actually focus on solving problems for your users.\nIII. Reflections on possibilities on implementing some of the webinar input on a practical level (practical application of learnings) The main thing that I really like to implement on a practical level would be the microservices. I have been really excited about the idea and want to implement it in some way in some of my projects but it just takes a lot of time to learn and I haven’t really had time to go and explore the idea.\nIV. Positive Feedback (on the event organization) Watching the event, you can really tell that they took their time to prepare and it really shows throughout the event. The MC was very engaging and keeps the energy all the way to the end. Furthermore, they also gave incentives for the audience to join with the icebreakers through prizes which makes the event all the more fun.\nV. Suggestions for improvements to be made/consider for future activities Although the event definitely went really smooth, there were still hiccups and it was mostly due to techinical difficulties such as the microphone of the speaker suddenly failing, the presentation not working, etc. While these cannot be avoided, I think that the organizers should always keep an eye out for such cases\nVI.
