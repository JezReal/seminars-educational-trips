Positive Feedback (on the event organization) The main positive feedback that I have is that the team were able to follow and stick to our schedule. In our previous webinar, we exceeded the time which in one side is great because it was still able to impart knowledge to our audience but on the other side, we still exceeded our expected time which is less than ideal.\nV. Suggestions for improvements to be made/consider for future activities The main suggestion that I have is to improve our future webinars is maybe to have some sort of interaction with the audience to encourage them to engage with the discussion\nVI.
